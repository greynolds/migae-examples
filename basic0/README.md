# Minimal Pure Java Servlet

This is a very simple example whose purpose is not to teach Java
servlet programming but to begin our exploration of how Clojure works.

Purpose: demonstrate how Leiningen handles Java code; jetty-runner and
dev_appserver

## Configuration

### Leiningen

project.clj:

```Clojure
:javac-options ["-nowarn" "-target" "1.7" "-source" "1.7" "-Xlint:all"]
:java-source-paths ["src/java"]
:compile-path "war/WEB-INF/classes"
:target-path "war/WEB-INF/lib"
```

`:java-source-paths` tells Leiningen where you have stored you Java
source.  The usual Java requirements with respect to file, directory
path, package, and object naming still applies.

`:compile-path` tells Leiningen where to put byte code (.class files)
resulting from either Java compilation (`lein javac`) or Clojure
aot-compilation (`lein compile`).

`target-path` tells Leiningen where to put jarfiles created by `lein
jar` or `lein uberjar`.

### Jetty

We use jetty-runner as our server; for more information, see [Use Jetty without an
installed
distribution](http://www.eclipse.org/jetty/documentation/current/jetty-runner.html)
and [Jetty/Howto/Using Jetty Runner](http://wiki.eclipse.org/Jetty/Howto/Using_Jetty_Runner).

### Java Servlet

Servlet configuration, the Servlet life-cycle, etc. are all well
described in the official documentation, at
http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=154.

In war/WEB-INF:
```
web.xml  -- standard Servlet deployment descriptor
appengine-web.xml -- required by GAE, ignored by std servlet containers
```

### Compile

    basic0	 $ lein javac

The result should be a file HelloWorld.class in war/WEB-INF/classes.

### Testing

#### Standard Servlet container

Now let's run jetty-server to test the servlet, first with lein-migae
then with ../migae-jetty.sh.

##### lein-migae

The "lein migae jetty" command makes some assumptions, such as that your jetty runner is called jetty-runner.jar, and is stored in $JARDIR.  See the code at 
https://github.com/mobileink/lein-migae/blob/master/src/leiningen/migae/jetty.clj

To make this work you must:

  1. Decide on a place to put jarfiles.  Good choices are ~/.jar
  (hidden), /usr/local/jar, /usr/local/lib.  Define an environment var
  JARDIR pointing to this dir and put it in ~/.bash_profile: export
  JARDIR="~/.jar".  Relaunch your terminal/shell to make this take effect.

  2. Download the jetty jars by running:
     	 basic0 $ lein deps
leiningen installs the jars in the local maven repository, which is usually ~/.m2/repository.  Which files to download is controlled by the :dependencies clause in the project.clj file.
  3. Find the jetty jars in the local maven repo.  See the project.clj
  file to discover the version number to look for.  For example:

    ~/.m2/repository/org/eclipse/jetty/jetty-runner/9.0.5.v20130815/jetty-runner-9.0.5.v20130815.jar

  4. Make a softlink from the jetty jar to your JARDIR: e.g.

    "~ $ ln -s ~/.m2/repository/org/eclipse/jetty/jetty-runner/9.0.5.v20130815/jetty-runner-9.0.5.v20130815.jar $JARDIR/jetty-runner.jar"

While you're at it, make a link for the clojure jar:

    ~ $ ln -s /.m2/repository/org/clojure/clojure/1.5.1/clojure-1.5.1.jar $JARDIR/jetty-runner.jar

Check your work:  $ ls -l $JARDIR  -- the -l flag will make ls display the links with "->"

Making links like this immunizes you from hardcoded version numbers.
When you install a new version, you can just redo the links instead of
editing lots of hardcoded versioned names.

Now launch:

    basic0 $ lein migae jetty start

If not, edit ./migae-jetty.sh as appropriate and do:

    basic0 $ ./migae-jetty.sh start

Use `ps` to verify that it's running and inspect the error log it
creates to make sure there are no errors.

(You can stop the server with `migae-jetty.sh stop` or `lein migae jetty stop`.)

Now send your browser to localhost:8080/.  You should get a "Hello World" result.

Take a look at jetty.err.log and jetty.rqst.log so you'll get an idea
of how jetty tries to communicate with us.

#### GAE dev_appserver

Stop the jetty server (`./migae-jetty.sh stop`) and do:

    basic0 $ ${GAESDK_HOME}/bin/dev_appserver.sh war

where ${GAESDK_HOME} is the path to your GAE SDK installation.

Note the messages in the console.

dev_appserver is configured to support so-called "hot" deployment.  If
you change web.xml or appengine-web.xml, the server will detect this
and reinitialize.  Try changing the version number in
appengine-web.xml to 0-1-1 and watch the console messages.
